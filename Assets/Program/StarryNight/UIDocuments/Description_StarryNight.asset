    The starry night was made with a random range node such
    as a noise node.


    By using the step node, the black dots in the previous
    node turned into radiant stars, and the white background turned into a black
    night sky.


    Lastly, by adding some colors and waves with the time node,
    the night sky was completed.


    One fun fact is that the Heart''s material
    is the same as the starry night material.
